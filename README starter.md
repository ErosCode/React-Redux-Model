# Start

In the project directory, you can run:

## `yarn`

To install all dependencies

### Version

My version of react-create-app mixed with what I learned in school. I wanted to run and have my folders well organized very fast so I did this. I didn't change any settings from create-react-app and I just added some features !

#### What's more ?

    - Organized react-redux folders to be ready to go
    - eslint
    - SASS
